- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Update architecture documentation
- [ ] API documentation generation

## Future Enhancements

### Inline handlebars helpers

The handlerbars helpers for rendering recursive structures (`hierarchy_tree`),
are defined in Rust code. Inlining these as handlebars code would allow for
greater flexibility in Custom export renderings
