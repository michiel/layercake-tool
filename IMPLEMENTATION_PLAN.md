# DAG Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) editor for the Layercake Tool frontend, allowing users to visually create, edit and configure plan DAGs.

## Stage 1: Basic Node Configuration Forms ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Create comprehensive configuration forms for all DAG node types
**Success Criteria**:
- All 6 node types (DataSource, Graph, Transform, Merge, Copy, Output) have working configuration forms
- Forms integrate with GraphQL for data fetching
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Frontend build completes successfully

**Tests**:
- ✅ Frontend builds without TypeScript errors
- ✅ All node configuration forms render without crashes
- ✅ GraphQL integration works for DataSource nodes

**Status**: Complete

### Implementation Details
- ✅ Created NodeConfigDialog component with dynamic form rendering
- ✅ Implemented 6 specialized configuration forms:
  - DataSourceNodeConfigForm (with GraphQL integration)
  - GraphNodeConfigForm
  - TransformNodeConfigForm (with transform-specific options)
  - MergeNodeConfigForm
  - CopyNodeConfigForm
  - OutputNodeConfigForm
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors:
  - Icon import issues (IconInfo → IconInfoCircle)
  - Duplicate property declarations in form configs
  - GraphQL type annotations
  - Component prop mismatches
  - JSX syntax errors

## Stage 2: Interactive Toolbar with Draggable Nodes ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Implement drag-and-drop functionality for adding new nodes to the DAG
**Success Criteria**:
- Toolbar with draggable node types
- Drag-and-drop creates new nodes in the canvas
- New nodes have unique IDs and default configurations
- Undo/redo functionality for node creation

**Tests**:
- ✅ Can drag each node type from toolbar to canvas
- ✅ New nodes appear with correct default configuration
- ✅ Node IDs are unique and properly generated
- ✅ Visual feedback during drag operations

**Status**: Complete

### Implementation Details
- ✅ Created NodeToolbar component with draggable node icons
- ✅ Implemented drag-and-drop handlers using HTML5 Drag API
- ✅ Added ReactFlowProvider wrapper for proper ReactFlow integration
- ✅ Created utility functions for:
  - Unique node ID generation with timestamps and random strings
  - Default configurations for each node type
  - Default metadata with appropriate labels
- ✅ Integrated toolbar into PlanVisualEditor layout
- ✅ Added visual feedback with tooltips and hover effects
- ✅ Implemented drop zone validation and positioning
- ✅ New nodes marked as "unconfigured" for easy identification

## Stage 3: Edge Creation and Management ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Enable visual creation and management of connections between nodes
**Success Criteria**:
- Click-and-drag to create edges between compatible node types
- Visual feedback during edge creation
- Edge validation (prevent cycles, enforce DAG structure)
- Edge deletion functionality

**Tests**:
- ✅ Can create edges between compatible nodes
- ✅ Cannot create cycles (DAG validation)
- ✅ Edge deletion works properly
- ✅ Visual feedback is clear and intuitive

**Status**: Complete

## Stage 4: Advanced Node Operations
**Goal**: Implement advanced node manipulation features
**Success Criteria**:
- Node duplication/cloning
- Bulk selection and operations
- Node grouping/ungrouping
- Copy/paste functionality

**Tests**:
- Node duplication preserves configuration
- Bulk operations work on multiple selections
- Copy/paste maintains proper references
- Grouping doesn't break DAG structure

**Status**: Not Started

## Stage 5: DAG Validation and Export
**Goal**: Comprehensive DAG validation and export functionality
**Success Criteria**:
- Real-time DAG validation with error reporting
- Export to various formats (YAML, JSON)
- Import existing DAG configurations
- Integration with backend plan execution

**Tests**:
- All validation rules enforced correctly
- Export/import maintains DAG integrity
- Backend integration works seamlessly
- Error messages are clear and actionable

**Status**: Not Started

## Recent Progress (2025-01-27)

### Phase 1 Completion - Build Fixes
Successfully resolved all TypeScript compilation errors in the node configuration forms:

1. **Icon Import Issues**: Fixed incorrect `IconInfo` imports, replaced with `IconInfoCircle` across all form components
2. **Duplicate Properties**: Resolved duplicate property declarations in form state initialization by proper ordering of spread operators
3. **GraphQL Integration**: Added proper TypeScript type annotations for GraphQL query responses in DataSourceNodeConfigForm
4. **Component Props**: Fixed NodeConfigDialog props interface to accept additional `config` and `metadata` props
5. **JSX Syntax**: Fixed JSX syntax error with `>` character by using expression syntax `{'>'}`

### Phase 2 Completion - Interactive Toolbar with Draggable Nodes
Successfully implemented comprehensive drag-and-drop functionality:

1. **NodeToolbar Component**: Created reusable toolbar with draggable node icons for all 6 node types
2. **Drag-and-Drop System**: Implemented HTML5 Drag API with proper event handling
3. **ReactFlow Integration**: Added ReactFlowProvider wrapper and useReactFlow hook integration
4. **Node Generation**: Created utilities for unique ID generation and default configurations
5. **Visual Design**: Added color-coded node types with tooltips and hover effects
6. **Drop Zone**: Implemented canvas drop zone with position calculation and validation

**Build Status**: ✅ Frontend builds successfully without TypeScript errors

### Phase 3 Completion - Edge Creation and Management
Successfully implemented comprehensive edge creation and management functionality:

1. **Enhanced Validation System**: Extended existing planDagValidation.ts with cycle detection algorithms
2. **DFS Cycle Detection**: Implemented depth-first search with recursion stack tracking to prevent DAG cycles
3. **Real-time Visual Feedback**: Added isValidConnection prop to ReactFlow for immediate connection validation
4. **Connection Management**: Enhanced onConnect handler with comprehensive validation and error reporting
5. **User Experience**: Added user-friendly alerts for invalid connections with clear error messages
6. **Edge Deletion**: Leveraged ReactFlow's built-in edge deletion with validation preserved

**Build Status**: ✅ Frontend builds successfully without TypeScript errors
