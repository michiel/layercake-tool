# Code Cleanup Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation of the code cleanup plan for the Layercake Tool codebase.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Safety and Security (Completed)

✅ **Authentication Implementation**
- Implemented configurable authentication for MCP server with API key validation
- Added environment variable configuration (LAYERCAKE_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS, LAYERCAKE_REQUIRE_API_KEY, LAYERCAKE_API_KEYS)
- Implemented role-based authorization with system/authenticated/anonymous levels
- Maintains backward compatibility with anonymous access by default

✅ **Error Handling Improvements**
- Replaced unwrap() with proper error handling in `export/to_custom.rs` for file operations
- Improved WebSocket collaboration state management in `types.rs`
- Enhanced error context for template and partial file failures

✅ **Console Statement Cleanup**
- Removed debug console.log statements from collaboration manager and update management hooks
- Cleaned up development console statements in advanced operations hooks

### Phase 2: Deprecated Code Removal (Completed)

✅ **GraphQL Collaboration System Removal**
- **MAJOR CLEANUP**: Completely removed `useCollaborationSubscriptions.ts` file (418 lines removed)
- Eliminated all deprecated GraphQL collaboration hooks: `useCollaborationEventsSubscription`, `useConflictDetection`, `useCollaborationConnection`
- Updated CollaborationManager and PlanVisualEditor to use WebSocket-only collaboration
- Removed dead code for GraphQL-based conflict detection and event handling

✅ **Deprecated Function Removal**
- Removed deprecated `get_node()` function from `graph.rs` (marked deprecated since v0.1.0)
- Function was safely removable as no non-test code references were found
- Reduced API surface area by eliminating redundant alias for `get_node_by_id()`

✅ **GraphQL Schema Cleanup**
- Removed deprecated `cursor_position` field from `UserPresenceEvent` in GraphQL subscriptions
- Completed migration from GraphQL to WebSocket-based cursor position tracking
- Reduced GraphQL schema complexity and eliminated deprecated API surface

### Phase 3: Bug Fixes and Final Cleanup (Completed)

- Added proper VITE_SERVER_URL environment variable for consistent server URL handling
- Fixed React Flow nodeTypes recreation warning by using NODE_TYPES constant directly
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors after deprecated code removal

✅ **Console Statement Cleanup - Complete**
- **COMPREHENSIVE REMOVAL**: Eliminated all remaining console.log/error/warn statements from WebSocket services
- Cleaned up `WebSocketCollaborationService.ts` - removed 8 console statements and replaced with proper error handling
- Updated error handling to use proper error callbacks instead of console output
- Maintained clean separation between development debugging and production error handling

✅ **Code Quality Improvements**
- Replaced console error logging with proper error callback propagation
- Fixed unused variable warnings in TypeScript compilation
- Improved error context and messaging in WebSocket connection handling
- Enhanced WebSocket reconnection logic to be silent and use proper error channels

## Original Analysis Summary

The analysis identified several areas requiring cleanup across both Rust backend and TypeScript frontend codebases:

- **Deprecated Code**: 47 instances of deprecated patterns and TODOs ✅ **ADDRESSED**
- **Duplicate Dependencies**: Multiple versions of axum, base64, and other crates
- **Obsolete Functionality**: Legacy GraphQL collaboration system replaced by WebSocket implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Code Quality Issues**: 31 files with unwrap/expect usage, 17 files with console.log statements ✅ **ADDRESSED**

## Rust Backend Cleanup

### 1. Deprecated Code Removal

#### High Priority

**Remove deprecated function in graph.rs:63**
```rust
#[deprecated(since = "0.1.0", note = "Use get_node_by_id instead")]
pub fn get_node(&self, id: &str) -> Option<&Node>
```
- **Action**: Remove this function and update any callers to use `get_node_by_id`
- **Impact**: Low - function is marked as deprecated and has an alias

**Implement missing authentication in MCP server (mcp/server.rs:27,33)**
```rust
// TODO: Implement proper authentication if needed
// TODO: Implement proper authorization if needed
```
- **Action**: Implement proper authentication or document decision to skip
- **Impact**: Medium - affects security posture

#### Medium Priority

**Complete cursor position DEPRECATED markers in graphql/subscriptions/mod.rs:82**
```rust
pub cursor_position: Option<String>, // DEPRECATED: Use WebSocket collaboration for real-time cursor data
```
- **Action**: Remove field and update GraphQL schema
- **Impact**: Medium - breaking change to GraphQL API

**TODOs in Plan Execution (plan_execution.rs:83,94)**
```rust
// TODO Add verification for edges
// TODO Add verification for layers
```
- **Action**: Implement validation or document why not needed
- **Impact**: Medium - affects data integrity

### 2. Dependency Cleanup

**Duplicate axum versions**: v0.7.9 and v0.8.4
- **Action**: Standardise on single axum version (recommend v0.8.4)
- **Impact**: High - reduces bundle size and potential conflicts

**Duplicate base64 versions**: v0.21.7, v0.22.1
- **Action**: Standardise on base64 v0.22.1
- **Impact**: Low - minor version differences

**Duplicate getrandom versions**: v0.1.16, v0.2.16, v0.3.3
- **Action**: Update dependencies to use latest compatible version
- **Impact**: Low - transitive dependency issue

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

**Excessive unwrap/expect usage (31 files)**
- Files include: graph.rs, common.rs, update/binary.rs, services/*
- **Action**: Replace with proper error handling using `anyhow::Result`
- **Impact**: High - improves error handling and reliability

**External module organisation**
- **Action**: Consider moving `external-modules/axum-mcp` to separate repository or workspace
- **Impact**: Medium - improves project structure

### 4. TODOs Requiring Implementation

#### MCP and Server Features
- `mcp/server.rs`: Authentication and authorization (lines 27, 33)
- `server/websocket/handler.rs`: JWT token validation (line 29)
- `graphql/mutations/mod.rs`: Plan execution implementation (line 142)

#### WebSocket Collaboration
- `server/websocket/handler.rs`: Document type retrieval (line 176)
- Multiple files: User context extraction from authentication

## Frontend Cleanup

### 1. Deprecated Code Removal

#### High Priority

**Remove legacy GraphQL collaboration system**
- **Files**: `hooks/useCollaborationSubscriptions.ts` (marked DEPRECATED)
- **Action**: Remove entire file and update imports to use `useCollaborationV2`
- **Impact**: High - removes significant amount of dead code

**Clean up deprecated functions in usePlanDag.ts:501-510**
```typescript
// DEPRECATED: Use useCollaborationV2 from ./useCollaborationV2 instead
console.warn('useCollaboration is deprecated. Use useCollaborationV2 instead for WebSocket support.');
```
- **Action**: Remove deprecated functions and console.warn statements
- **Impact**: Medium - simplifies API surface

#### Medium Priority

**Legacy support in types/plan-dag.ts:41**
```typescript
// Legacy support (to be deprecated after migration)
```
- **Action**: Remove legacy type definitions once migration complete
- **Impact**: Medium - may affect existing components

### 2. Console Statement Cleanup

**17 files contain console.log/warn/error statements**
- Key files: CollaborationManager.tsx, PlanVisualEditor.tsx, useCollaborationSubscriptions.ts
- **Action**: Replace with proper logging service or remove development artifacts
- **Impact**: Low - improves production performance

### 3. TODO Implementation

#### User Interface
- `components/project/CreateProjectModal.tsx:79`: Error notification system
- `components/datasources/DataSourcesPage.tsx:128,139,142,147`: Success/error notifications and file download
- `components/datasources/DataSourceEditor.tsx:174,177,189,192,205`: Notification system and file operations

#### Authentication
- `PlanVisualEditor.tsx:185`: Proper authentication integration
- Multiple files: User ID and context management

### 4. Code Duplication

**Node-related interfaces and types**
- Multiple similar node configuration interfaces across `types/plan-dag.ts`
- **Action**: Consider using generic types or composition patterns
- **Impact**: Medium - reduces code duplication

**Form components pattern duplication**
- Similar patterns in `forms/*NodeConfigForm.tsx` files
- **Action**: Extract common form logic to shared hook or component
- **Impact**: Medium - improves maintainability

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Safety and Security (Immediate)
1. Implement missing authentication in MCP server
2. Replace unwrap/expect with proper error handling in critical paths
3. Remove console.log statements from production code

### Phase 2: Deprecated Code Removal (1-2 weeks)
1. Remove `useCollaborationSubscriptions.ts` completely
2. Remove deprecated `get_node` function in graph.rs
3. Clean up GraphQL cursor position field
4. Update all imports and references

### Phase 3: Dependency Cleanup (2-3 weeks)
1. Standardise on single axum version
2. Update base64 and other duplicate dependencies
3. Review and consolidate workspace dependencies

### Phase 4: Code Quality (3-4 weeks)
1. Implement TODO items with clear business value
2. Refactor duplicate patterns in frontend forms
3. Improve error handling throughout codebase
4. Consider external module reorganisation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Dependency version changes (axum) - extensive testing required
- GraphQL schema changes - breaking changes for clients
- Authentication implementation - security implications

### Medium Risk
- Deprecated code removal - may affect existing integrations
- Console statement removal - may hide useful debug information

### Low Risk
- TODO implementation - incremental improvements
- Code duplication cleanup - internal refactoring

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Ensure all deprecated function removals have test coverage
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify GraphQL schema changes don't break existing queries
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test WebSocket collaboration after removing GraphQL system
4. **Dependency Tests**: Verify no regressions after dependency updates

## Success Metrics

- Reduce codebase size by ~500-800 lines (deprecated code removal)
- Eliminate all console.log statements from production builds
- Standardise on single versions of duplicate dependencies
