## Technical Architecture Memory

### **Data Flow Architecture**:
```
User Action → Apollo Mutation → GraphQL Resolver → Database
                ↓
        Optimistic Response → UI Update
                ↓
        GraphQL Subscription → Real-time Broadcast → Other Users
```

### **State Management Pattern**:
```
Apollo Client Cache = Single Source of Truth
  ├── Local State (UI preferences, selections)
  ├── Remote State (projects, graphs, plans)
  ├── Subscription State (real-time updates)
  └── Offline State (queued operations)
```

### **Component Hierarchy**:
```
App
├── Layout
│   ├── Navigation
│   └── ConnectionStatus
├── ProjectList
├── ProjectCreate
└── PlanVisualEditor
    ├── ReactFlow Canvas
    ├── Node Configuration Dialogs
    └── UserPresence Indicators
```

  version: "1.0",
  nodes: [
    { id: 'input_1', type: PlanDagNodeType.INPUT, ... },    // CSV Import
    { id: 'transform_1', type: PlanDagNodeType.TRANSFORM, ... }, // Filter Nodes
    { id: 'output_1', type: PlanDagNodeType.OUTPUT, ... }   // Export DOT
  ],
  edges: [
    { id: 'edge_1', source: 'input_1', target: 'transform_1', ... },
    { id: 'edge_2', source: 'transform_1', target: 'output_1', ... }
  ],

# 3. Click "Plan Editor" in sidebar
# 4. Test the fully functional collaborative visual editor:
#    - 3 nodes display automatically (CSV Import → Filter → Export)
#    - Drag nodes to reposition (real-time collaboration ready)
#    - Select nodes and edges for interaction
#    - Use ReactFlow controls (zoom, pan, fit view)
#    - Try creating new connections (validation prevents invalid links)
#    - Double-click nodes to open configuration dialogs
#    - See collaborative user presence indicators (2 online users shown)
#    - Watch collaborative cursors move with zoom/pan operations
#    - Check browser console for collaboration events
