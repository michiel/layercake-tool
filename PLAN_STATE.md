# Phase 1 Implementation Plan - State Tracking

> **🔄 SYNC REMINDER**: Keep this file synchronized with IMPLEMENTATION.md - any changes to Phase 1 scope, timeline, or technical decisions must be reflected in both files.

## Phase 1: Frontend Foundation (Months 1-4)

### Overview

## Technical Architecture Memory

### **Data Flow Architecture**:
```
User Action → Apollo Mutation → GraphQL Resolver → Database
                ↓
        Optimistic Response → UI Update
                ↓
        GraphQL Subscription → Real-time Broadcast → Other Users
```

### **State Management Pattern**:
```
Apollo Client Cache = Single Source of Truth
  ├── Local State (UI preferences, selections)
  ├── Remote State (projects, graphs, plans)
  ├── Subscription State (real-time updates)
  └── Offline State (queued operations)
```

### **Component Hierarchy**:
```
App
├── Layout
│   ├── Navigation
│   └── ConnectionStatus
├── ProjectList
├── ProjectCreate
└── PlanVisualEditor
    ├── ReactFlow Canvas
    ├── Node Configuration Dialogs
    └── UserPresence Indicators
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **Technical Risks**:
1. **Apollo Client Learning Curve**
   - Mitigation: Dedicate time for team Apollo Client training
   - Fallback: Detailed documentation and code examples

2. **ReactFlow Performance with Large Graphs**
   - Mitigation: Implement virtualization for 1000+ nodes
   - Fallback: Pagination or level-of-detail rendering

3. **Real-time Subscription Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple presence, build complexity gradually
   - Fallback: Polling-based updates if subscriptions fail

### **Timeline Risks**:
1. **Tauri v2 Compatibility Issues**
   - Mitigation: Early prototype to validate integration
   - Buffer: Additional 2 weeks for platform-specific fixes

2. **GraphQL Schema Evolution**
   - Mitigation: Version GraphQL schema changes
   - Tool: Apollo Studio for schema validation

### **Phase 2 Prerequisites** (to be ready by Month 4):
- [ ] Backend GraphQL API with Plan DAG operations
- [ ] Database schema with Plan and LayercakeGraph tables
- [ ] MCP server integration framework
- [ ] Development environment documentation

### **Technical Debt to Address**:
