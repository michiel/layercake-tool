# Refactoring Improvements

This document outlines the refactoring changes that were made to improve the codebase maintainability.

## 1. Improved Export Module Organization

Added a common renderer module in `export/mod.rs` to reduce duplication across export implementations:

- Created `renderer::render_template` and `renderer::create_standard_context` functions
- Updated exporters (dot, plantuml) to use the common renderer
- This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to add new exporters

## 2. Refactored Plan Execution

Broke down the large `run_plan` function in `plan_execution.rs` into smaller, more focused functions:

- `create_graph_from_plan` - Initializes a new graph with metadata
- `load_data_into_graph` - Loads data from import profiles
- `apply_graph_transformations` - Applies various transforms to the graph
- `export_graph` - Handles exporting to different formats
- `watch_for_changes` - Set up file watching

This improves readability, makes the code easier to test, and separates concerns.

## 3. Added Documentation

Added function documentation comments to explain:

- Purpose of functions
- Parameter meanings
- Return values
- Error conditions

## 4. Improved Error Handling

- Made error messages more descriptive
- Used proper error handling patterns with `anyhow::Error`
- Added explicit error type conversions rather than unsafe propagation

## 5. Organized Helper Functions

- Clarified the scope and use of common helper functions
- Added private helper methods to the `Graph` implementation
- Ensured consistent naming patterns for helpers

## 6. Added Tests

Added tests for previously untested complex methods:

- `test_invert_graph`
- `test_modify_graph_limit_partition_width`
- `test_modify_graph_limit_partition_depth`
- `test_aggregate_edges`
- `test_verify_graph_integrity`

## 7. Fixed Bugs

- Fixed a bug in `verify_graph_integrity` where non-partition nodes were incorrectly identified
- Added proper test to verify the fix

## 8. Addressed Deprecated Methods

- Marked `get_node` as deprecated in favor of `get_node_by_id` for a more consistent API
- Made `get_node` an alias to `get_node_by_id` to maintain backward compatibility

## Remaining Work

- Fix the integration test that's now failing
- Replace the remaining uses of deprecated `get_node` with `get_node_by_id`
- Fix the remaining warnings for unused mutable variables
- Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
