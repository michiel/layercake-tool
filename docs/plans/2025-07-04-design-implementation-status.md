- **Handlebars**: Flexible templating for custom output formats

### Recommendations for Frontend
- **React + TypeScript**: Type safety and ecosystem maturity
- **GraphQL**: Matches existing backend API design
- **D3.js or Vis.js**: Powerful graph visualization libraries
- **SSE Integration**: Real-time updates without WebSocket complexity

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: All design goals implemented and tested
2. **Performance**: Handles graphs with 10,000+ nodes efficiently
3. **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal documentation
4. **Reliability**: Zero-downtime updates and robust error handling
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new export formats and analysis tools

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Frontend Complexity**: Start with MVP and iterate
2. **Performance Issues**: Implement incremental loading and virtualization
3. **Database Migrations**: Extensive testing with sample data
4. **Cross-Platform**: Continuous testing on Linux, macOS, Windows
5. **API Stability**: Version APIs and maintain backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Phase 1 React frontend setup
2. **Week 2**: Complete basic project management interface
3. **Week 3**: Implement graph visualization and real-time updates
4. **Month 2**: Advanced features and performance optimization
5. **Month 3**: Polish, documentation, and deployment automation

The foundation is solid with most backend infrastructure complete. The focus should be on frontend implementation and advanced graph features to fully realize the design vision.
