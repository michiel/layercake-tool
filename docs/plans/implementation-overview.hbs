## Plan Structure

This implementation plan is structured as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that can be executed through the Layercake pipeline system. The plan supports partial execution by allowing individual tasks or phases to be run independently based on their dependencies.

## Architecture Overview

The implementation focuses on creating a **modular React frontend** with:

### Core Features
- **Dynamic Component Loading**: Large editors (ReactFlow, Isoflow) are loaded on-demand
- **Dual-Mode Plan Editor**: Switch between rich-text YAML and visual ReactFlow interface
- **Spreadsheet Editor**: Tabbed interface for editing layers, nodes, and edges
- **Real-time Updates**: SSE-based live graph synchronization
- **Component Registry**: Plugin system for extensible editor components

### Key Components

#### 1. Plan Editor System
- **YAML Editor**: Rich text editor with syntax highlighting and validation
- **ReactFlow Editor**: Visual DAG editor for plan construction
- **Plan Serialization**: Bidirectional conversion between YAML and visual formats

#### 2. Data Management
- **Spreadsheet Interface**: Excel-like editing with tabs for:
  - Layers (graph organization)
  - Nodes (graph vertices)
  - Edges (graph connections)
- **Data Validation**: Real-time validation and error highlighting
- **GraphQL Integration**: Backend synchronization

#### 3. Visualization
- **Graph Canvas**: D3.js-based graph visualization
- **Interactive Editing**: Drag-and-drop node positioning
- **Live Updates**: Real-time graph changes via SSE

## Dependency Graph

The implementation follows a strict dependency ordering:

```
React Setup → Module System → Component Registry
                          ↓
                     Large Editors (ReactFlow, Isoflow)
                          ↓
                   Plan Editor Components
                          ↓
                  Data Integration & Spreadsheet
                          ↓
                    Frontend Foundation
                          ↓
                 Advanced Graph Features
                          ↓
                   Enhanced User Experience
                          ↓
                 Performance & Scalability
```

### Critical Path
The critical path for the implementation includes:
1. React Setup & Module System
2. Component Registry & UI Components  
3. Plan Editor with dual-mode support
4. Spreadsheet editor for data management
5. Graph visualization and real-time updates

## Pipeline Execution

This plan can be executed through the Layercake pipeline system:

### Full Execution
```bash
cargo run -- -p docs/plans/2025-07-04-design-implementation-plan.yaml
```

### Partial Execution Examples

#### Phase 1 Only
```bash
cargo run -- -p docs/plans/2025-07-04-design-implementation-plan.yaml --filter-layers phase-1
```

#### Specific Components
```bash
cargo run -- -p docs/plans/2025-07-04-design-implementation-plan.yaml --filter-nodes react-setup,module-system,component-registry
```

#### Dependencies Analysis
```bash
cargo run -- -p docs/plans/2025-07-04-design-implementation-plan.yaml --analyze-critical-path
```

## Success Metrics

- [ ] **Modular Architecture**: Components load dynamically without blocking main thread
- [ ] **Plan Editor**: Seamless switching between YAML and visual editing
- [ ] **Data Management**: Spreadsheet interface supports bulk operations
- [ ] **Performance**: Handles 10,000+ nodes with smooth interactions
- [ ] **Extensibility**: New editor components can be added without core changes

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize React App**: Set up modular architecture with TypeScript
2. **Implement Module System**: Configure dynamic loading and code splitting
3. **Build Component Registry**: Create plugin system for editors
4. **Develop Plan Editor**: Implement dual-mode YAML/ReactFlow interface
5. **Create Spreadsheet Editor**: Build tabbed data management interface

This DAG-based approach ensures that each component can be developed and tested independently while maintaining clear dependency relationships.
